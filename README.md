# proteinhp
Trying to solve 2D protein folding problem in java.

MonteCarlo and GA used
Brute Force used to calculate structure for residue length less than 15.

Implemented 2D structure prediction module for H-P (coarse) model of proteins to visualize how the structures fold using Java Swing.
Used Monte Carlo based stochastic optimization and Genetic Algorithms to fold the molecules to lowest energy.
Could be used as a scientific tool for studying the folding process.
